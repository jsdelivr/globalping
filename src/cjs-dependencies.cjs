// The reason for `require('koa')` is that '@newrelic/koa' package (a part of 'newrelic' package) can't handle ES import. Error message:

// with CommonJS require and further import it works fine.
const Koa = require('koa');
// Also we need to `requre` winston so it is successfully updated by newrelic, in case of import winson is not patched and not sending logs.
